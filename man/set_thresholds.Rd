\title{Specify thresholds for detecting phenological events}
\usage{
set_thresholds(
  thres_up = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.1) \%>\% round(1),
  thres_down = seq(from = 1, to = 0, by = -0.1) \%>\% round(1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{thres_up}{Numeric vector. Threshold values for increasing trends (default: seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.1) \%>\% round(1)).}

\item{thres_down}{Numeric vector. Threshold values for decreasing trends (default: seq(from = 1, to = 0, by = -0.1) \%>\% round(1)).}
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns:
\item{direction}{A character vector indicating "up" for increasing trends or "down" for decreasing trends.}
\item{threshold}{A numeric vector containing threshold values between 0 and 1.}
}
\description{
Creates a data frame with threshold values for both increasing ("up") and decreasing ("down") trends. These thresholds are used to detect phenological events in the time series.
}
\examples{
# Get default thresholds (for increasing and decreasing trends)
default_thres <- set_thresholds()

# Get thresholds with custom rule
custom_thres <- set_thresholds(thres_up = c(0.3, 0.5), thres_down = NULL)

}

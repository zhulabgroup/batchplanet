\title{Generate Threshold Values for Significant Events}
\usage{
set_thresholds(
  thres_up = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.1) \%>\% round(1),
  thres_down = seq(from = 1, to = 0, by = -0.1) \%>\% round(1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{custom_rule}{A list specifying custom threshold rules. If \code{NULL} (default),
a default set of thresholds is returned.}
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns:
\item{direction}{A character vector indicating "up" for increasing trends or "down" for decreasing trends.}
\item{threshold}{A numeric vector containing threshold values between 0 and 1.}
}
\description{
Creates a data frame with candidate threshold values for both increasing
and decreasing trends. Optionally, users can apply custom rules to filter the thresholds
based on specific conditions (e.g., applying to specific types of data or indices).
}
\examples{
# Get default thresholds (for increasing and decreasing trends)
default_thres <- set_thresholds()

# Get thresholds with custom rule
custom_thres <- set_thresholds(custom_rule = list(up = 0.7, down = 0.3))

}

\title{Read and combine processed data products}
\usage{
read_data_product(dir, v_site = NULL, v_group = NULL, product_type = "clean")
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{Character. Base directory containing processed data product files (e.g., the parent directory of "ts/", "clean/", or "doy/").}

\item{v_site}{Character vector, optional. Site identifiers to include; if \code{NULL}, all sites are included.}

\item{v_group}{Character vector, optional. Group identifiers to include; if \code{NULL}, all groups are included.}

\item{product_type}{Character. Type of product to read (e.g., "ts", "clean", or "doy"). Default is "clean".}
}
\value{
A data frame combining all matching data product files, with columns for site and group.
}
\description{
Reads and combines data files processed with this package(e.g., time series, cleaned remote sensing index, or phenological metrics).
Supports reading a subset of data from specified sites and groups.
Three data products are supported:
\itemize{
\item "ts": raw time series data
\item "clean": cleaned time series data, with optionally calculated Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)
\item "doy": extracted phenological metrics
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example: Read all cleaned time series for two sites and one group
df_clean <- read_data_product(
  dir = "alldata/PSdata/",
  v_site = c("HARV", "SJER"),
  v_group = "Quercus",
  product_type = "clean"
)

# Example: Read all phenological metrics for a site
df_doy <- read_data_product(
  dir = "alldata/PSdata/",
  v_site = "SJER",
  product_type = "doy"
)
}

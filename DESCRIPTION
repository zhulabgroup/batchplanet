Description: 
    Batchplanet is an R package that provides a comprehensive suite of tools for processing, 
    analyzing, and visualizing remote sensing dataâ€”particularly PlanetScope imagery. The package 
    includes functions to read and validate spatial datasets (e.g., county and subdivision shapefiles), 
    set custom thresholds for monitoring, and generate bounding boxes for targeted areas. 
    It streamlines workflows for ordering and downloading imagery via the Planet API, and it offers robust 
    routines for processing satellite time series data, computing indices, and calculating 
    day-of-year (DOY) metrics for green-up and green-down events. Additionally, Batchplanet leverages 
    efficient parallel processing and state-of-the-art smoothing techniques (e.g., Whittaker smoothing) 
    to handle large environmental datasets, making it a valuable tool for researchers in remote sensing 
    and ecological monitoring.
